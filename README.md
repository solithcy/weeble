# Weeble

## Getting started
First, you need to install all dependencies with `npm i`. Then, if you want to redownload character information run `node prepare_resources`. To start the server, run `npm start`.
## Production
To build for production, run `npm run build`. Your MAL api key won't be stored in the source code, so it won't show up in the build.
## Notes
This site hasn't been properly optimized for mobile devices. It is recommended to use a desktop browser, as the sizing on mobile devices is a bit off.
